# SSVEP-FlashingStimulus
 A collection of resources I developed during a summer research scholarship at Flinders where I was tasked with developing software to provide a configurable flashing stimulus to use for SSVEP BCI experiments.

* DX11 Flasher v3 is the final version software I developed with DX11 and C++ incoporating the AntTweakBar. 
* The DX11 Flasher v3 folder also has a tools folder with some other code I wrote for automating conversion of Movies to PNGs and conversion using the texconv.exe tool to convert to .dds.
* XNAC# Flasher is an initial version using XNA that I wrote and then stopped using when I didn't have enough control over the frame rate for what was necessary. Included for posterity.
